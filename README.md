Q) Why powershell
A) because of who I am as a person and because sed is hard to learn in the limited amount of free time I have.
... but mostly because of who I am as a person.

Q) What does all this do anyway?
A) Sets some ncurses variables so that yast boxes are drawn with lines instead of letters. Also switches the yast color scheme to something that plays well with my monokai putty theme. If you're administering yast through putty, but especially with any non-default color scheme, this ought to make life suck less for you.
